But later were defined (singly) extended Reed-Solomon codes, which include the 0 and thus 256 values, and then doubly extended Reed-Solomon codes which include the 0 and 256 == infinity.

    '''Compute the list of prime polynomials for the given generator and galois field characteristic exponent.'''
    # fast_primes will output less results but will be significantly faster.
    # single will output the first prime polynomial found, so if all you want is to just find one prime polynomial to generate the LUT for Reed-Solomon to work, then just use that.

    # A prime polynomial (necessarily irreducible) is necessary to reduce the multiplications in the Galois Field, so as to avoid overflows.
    # Why do we need a "prime polynomial"? Can't we just reduce modulo 255 (for GF(2^8) for example)? Because we need the values to be unique.
    # For example: if the generator (alpha) = 2 and c_exp = 8 (GF(2^8) == GF(256)), then the generated Galois Field (0, 1, α, α^1, α^2, ..., α^(p-1)) will be galois field it becomes 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, etc. However, upon reaching 128, the next value will be doubled (ie, next power of 2), which will give 256. Then we must reduce, because we have overflowed above the maximum value of 255. But, if we modulo 255, this will generate 256 == 1. Then 2, 4, 8, 16, etc. giving us a repeating pattern of numbers. This is very bad, as it's then not anymore a bijection (ie, a non-zero value doesn't have a unique index). That's why we can't just modulo 255, but we need another number above 255, which is called the prime polynomial.
    # Why so much hassle? Because we are using precomputed look-up tables for multiplication: instead of multiplying a*b, we precompute alpha^a, alpha^b and alpha^(a+b), so that we can just use our lookup table at alpha^(a+b) and get our result. But just like in our original field we had 0,1,2,...,p-1 distinct unique values, in our "LUT" field using alpha we must have unique distinct values (we don't care that they are different from the original field as long as they are unique and distinct). That's why we need to avoid duplicated values, and to avoid duplicated values we need to use a prime irreducible polynomial.

    # Here is implemented a bruteforce approach to find all these prime polynomials, by generating every possible prime polynomials (ie, every integers between field_charac+1 and field_charac*2), and then we build the whole Galois Field, and we reject the candidate prime polynomial if it duplicates even one value or if it generates a value above field_charac (ie, cause an overflow).
    # Note that this algorithm is slow if the field is too big (above 12), because it's an exhaustive search algorithm. There are probabilistic approaches, and almost surely prime approaches, but there is no determistic polynomial time algorithm to find irreducible monic polynomials.

    The basic idea is quite simple: since b**(log_b(x), log_b(y)) == x * y given any number b (the base or generator of the logarithm), then we can use any number b to precompute logarithm and anti-log (exponentiation) tables to use for multiplying two numbers x and y.

That's why it makes sense to refer to all the finite fields, and all decoders based on Reed-Solomon, of size p^n as one concept: GF(p^n).

        This procedure is called Russian Peasant Multiplication algorithm, which is just a general algorithm to multiply two integers together.
        The only two differences that you need to account for when doing multiplication in a finite field (as opposed to just integers) are:
        1- carry-less addition and substraction (XOR in GF(2^p))
        2- modular reduction (to avoid duplicate values in the field) using a prime polynomial

Note that since we're in GF(2), the addition is in fact an XOR (very important because in GF(2) the multiplication and additions are carry-less, thus it changes the result!).

If you comment this line out, you get the same result as standard multiplication on integers.
