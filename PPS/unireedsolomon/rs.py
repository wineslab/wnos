'''This module implements a universal errors-and-erasures Reed-Solomon Encoding and Decoding.
It supports arbitrary configurations for n and k, the codeword length and
message length. This can be used to adjust the error correcting power of the
code.

It also supports any configurations for the generator, the prime polynomial, the
first consecutive root and the Galois Field's characteristic (ie, you are not limited
to GF(2^8)). This allows this module to interface with any other RS codec
(ie, you can decode the codeword output of any other RS codec if you provide
the correct parameters here).

Warning: Because of the way I've implemented things, leading null bytes in a
message are dropped. Be careful if encoding binary data, pad the data yourself
to k bytes per block to avoid problems. Also see the nostrip option to
decode().

When called as a script, this file encodes data from standard in and outputs it
to standard out, using the standard RS code 255,223. This is suitable for
encoding text and trying it out, but don't try to encode binary data with it!

When encoding, it outputs blocks of 255 bytes, 223 of them are data (padded
with leading null bytes if necessary) and then 32 bytes of parity data.

Use the -d flag to decode data on standard in to standard out. This reads in
blocks of 255 bytes, and outputs the decoded data from them. If there are less
than 16 errors per block, your data will be recovered.

        The other parameters are optional (but allows compatibility with all RS encoders/decoders):
        - generator is the generator number (the "increment" that will be used to walk through the field by multiplication, this must be a prime number)
        - prim is the prime/primitive (binary) polynomial and must be irreducible (it can't represented as the product of two smaller polynomials). It's a polynomial in the binary sense: each bit is a coefficient, but in fact it's an integer between 2^p and (2^p)*2, and not a list of gf values.
        - fcr is the first consecutive root
        - c_exp is the exponent of the Galois Field's characteristic: GF(2^c_exp). This both define the maximum possible value for one symbol, and the maximum length of a message+ecc (n == 2^c_exp). Note that for different c_exp, you must use a different prime polynomial (prim).

        A message always has k bytes, if a message contained less it is left
        padded with null bytes. When decoded, these leading null bytes are
        stripped, but that can cause problems if decoding binary data. When
        nostrip is True, messages returned are always k bytes long. This is
        useful to make sure no data is lost when decoding binary data.
        
        Theoretically, we have R(x) = C(x) + E(x) + V(x), where R is the received message, C is the correct message without errors nor erasures, E are the errors and V the erasures. Thus the goal is to compute E and V from R, so that we can compute: C(x) = R(x) - E(x) - V(x), and then we have our original message! The main problem of decoding is to solve the so-called Key Equation, here we use Berlekamp-Massey.
        
        When stated in the language of spectral estimation, consists of a Fourier transform (syndrome computer), followed by a spectral analysis (Berlekamp-Massey or Euclidian algorithm), followed by an inverse Fourier transform (Chien search).

        '''Faster decoding of a message with ecc bytes, using optimized algorithms (use PyPy to get really fast!).

        Given a received string or byte array or list r of values between
        0 and gf2_charac, attempts to decode it. If it's a valid codeword, or
        if there are no more than (n-k)/2 errors, the repaired message is returned.

        A message always has k bytes, if a message contained less it is left
        padded with null bytes. When decoded, these leading null bytes are
        stripped, but that can cause problems if decoding binary data. When
        nostrip is True, messages returned are always k bytes long. This is
        useful to make sure no data is lost when decoding binary data.

        Theoretically, we have R(x) = C(x) + E(x) + V(x), where R is the received message, C is the correct message without errors nor erasures, E are the errors and V the erasures. Thus the goal is to compute E and V from R, so that we can compute: C(x) = R(x) - E(x) - V(x), and then we have our original message! The main problem of decoding is to solve the so-called Key Equation, here we use Berlekamp-Massey.

        If the erasures locator is specified, we will return an errors-and-erasures locator polynomial and an errors-and-erasures evaluator polynomial, else it will compute only errors. With erasures in addition to errors, it can simultaneously decode up to v+2e <= (n-k) where v is the number of erasures and e the number of errors.
        Mathematically speaking, this is equivalent to a spectral analysis (see Blahut, "Algebraic Codes for Data Transmission", 2003, chapter 7.6 Decoding in Time Domain).
        The parameter s is the syndrome polynomial (syndromes encoded in a
        generator function) as returned by _syndromes.

        Notes:
        The error polynomial:
        E(x) = E_0 + E_1 x + ... + E_(n-1) x^(n-1)

        j_1, j_2, ..., j_s are the error positions. (There are at most s
        errors)

        Error location X_i is defined: X_i = α^(j_i)
        that is, the power of α (alpha) corresponding to the error location

        Error magnitude Y_i is defined: E_(j_i)
        that is, the coefficient in the error polynomial at position j_i

        Error locator polynomial:
        sigma(z) = Product( 1 - X_i * z, i=1..s )
        roots are the reciprocals of the error locations
        ( 1/X_1, 1/X_2, ...)

        Error evaluator polynomial omega(z) is here computed at the same time as sigma, but it can also be constructed afterwards using the syndrome and sigma (see _find_error_evaluator() method).

        It can be seen that the algorithm tries to iteratively solve for the error locator polynomial by
        solving one equation after another and updating the error locator polynomial. If it turns out that it
        cannot solve the equation at some step, then it computes the error and weights it by the last
        non-zero discriminant found, and delays the weighted result to increase the polynomial degree
        by 1. Ref: "Reed Solomon Decoder: TMS320C64x Implementation" by Jagadeesh Sankaran, December 2000, Application Report SPRA686

            # Compute Yl
            # This is a more faithful translation of the theoretical equation contrary to the old forney method. Here it is exactly copy/pasted from the included presentation decoding_rs.pdf: Yl = omega(Xl.inverse()) / prod(1 - Xj*Xl.inverse()) for j in len(X) (in the paper it's for j in s, but it's useless when len(X) < s because we compute neutral terms 1 for nothing, and wrong when correcting more than s erasures or erasures+errors since it prevents computing all required terms).
            # Thus here this method works with erasures too because firstly we fixed the equation to be like the theoretical one (don't know why it was modified in _old_forney(), if it's an optimization, it doesn't enhance anything), and secondly because we removed the product bound on s, which prevented computing errors and erasures above the s=(n-k)//2 bound.
            # The best resource I have found for the correct equation is https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forney_algorithm -- note that in the article, fcr is defined as c.
            Yl = - (Xl**(1-self.fcr)  * omega.evaluate(Xl_inv) / sigma_prime) # sigma_prime is the denominator of the Forney algorithm

# Not implemented here (because it must be implemented by the interface that will use this library) are the 6 techniques of modifying ecc codes. Here is a brief summary:
# defining a message by its length n, its dimension k, and its redundancy r = n−k, we can modify it by :
# (i) Augmenting. Fix n; increase k; decrease r.
# (ii) Expurgating. Fix n; decrease k; increase r.
# (iii) Extending. Fix k; increase n; increase r.
# (iv) Puncturing. Fix k; decrease n; decrease r.
# (v) Lengthening. Fix r; increase n; increase k.
# (vi) Shortening. Fix r; decrease n; decrease k.
# In practice, for example, puncturing is the removal of parity symbols from a codeword, and shortening is the removal of message symbols from a codeword and padding with 0.
# Here's a great intro: http://users.math.msu.edu/users/jhall/classes/codenotes/Mod.pdf
